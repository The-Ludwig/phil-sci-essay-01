"Explanation Provides Truth" is my first essay I have written and 
I received some fair criticism for some of my arguments here.
I don't necessarily agree with all of my points anymore, so 
see this as a snapshot of my thoughts on the topic at that time.

Also, it is absolutely possible that I misunderstood Nancy Cartwright, so 
take everything with a pinch of salt.

# Credits
As with all of my LaTeX stuff: Since I learned it thanks to the [PeP Toolbox Workshop](https://toolbox.pep-dortmund.org/)
you will probably find a lot of copied code from their workshop. If you want to learn LaTeX and speak German, have a look at their awesome resources! :)
