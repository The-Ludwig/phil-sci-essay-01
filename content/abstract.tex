\emph{Laws of nature} are
important objects in the philosophy
of science.
\emph{Nancy Cartwright}
doubts the importance of natural laws in science in her
1983 essay \enquote{The Truth Doesn't Explain Much}.
She refuses any \emph{covering law} (c.l.) models
of explanation, and says that determining good explanations is the central job of science.
She observes that
science mostly uses
\emph{ceteris paribus} (c.p.) generalizations to explain, instead of truly general laws of nature.
I argue that science indeed uses c.p. generalizations,
but that they are, contrary to Cartwright, laws of nature.
