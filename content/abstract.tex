This essay starts with a discussion on the role
of \emph{laws of nature} in the philosophy
of science.
I go on to explain \emph{Nancy Cartwright's}
positions on laws of nature expressed in her
1983 essay \enquote{The Truth Doesn't Explain Much}.
Which puts the importance of
laws of nature in science to question,
and thus refuses any \emph{covering law} model
of explanation.
The role of the explanatory process is
key in her scientific model.
I argue that her key observation,
science mostly uses
\emph{ceteris paribus} generalizations to explain, instead of truly general laws, is right,
but that they do fulfill the requirements of laws of nature.
In fact, science uses somewhat general laws of nature all the time,
and in doing so provides some truths about nature.
